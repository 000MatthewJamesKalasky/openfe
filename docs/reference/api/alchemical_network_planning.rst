Simulation Campaign Planning
============================

Alchemical network planners are objects that pull all the ideas in OpenFE
into a quick setup for simulation. The goal is to create the
:class:`.AlchemicalNetwork` that represents an entire simulation campaign,
starting from a bare amount of user input. This also requries several helper
classes along the way.
